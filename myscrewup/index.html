		<div class="all about">
			<p>I could give many different reasons as to why I am a designer and why I felt this was the direction I wanted to follow in life. I could explain that it is because of my love of problem solving, having that opportunity to help a struggle become a solution or I could say it is because at a young age I had a very influential design teacher. But, really, I could never pick one reason. It is a compilation of all my experiences and all of my passions building up to create who I am. Everyday I have a different reason for doing what I do, whether I am creating a graphic or laying out a floor plan, it influences me in it’s own way. I create because it’s what I need to do and if I can share this need with other people and inspire their day, than I will keep creating until I can’t hold a pencil or a mouse anymore.<p>
